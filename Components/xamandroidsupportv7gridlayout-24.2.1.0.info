{"Name":"Android Support Library V7 GridLayout","Id":3120,"Alias":"xamandroidsupportv7gridlayout","Description":"# v7 GridLayout Android Support Library\n\nThe v7 GridLayout Support Library adds support for the GridLayout class, which allows you to arrange user interface elements using a grid of rectangular cells.\n\n\n\n\n## Android Support Libraries\n\nThe Android Support Libraries are a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running older versions of Android.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. \n\n\n","Version":"24.2.1.0","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"v7 Support GridLayout Library\n=========================\n\nThis library adds support for the `GridLayout` class, which allows you to arrange user interface elements \nusing a grid of rectangular cells.\n\n### Target SDK Version \nNOTE: Using this support library requires that your app have its Target Android Version (*targetSdkVersion*) set to Lollipop (5.0 - API Level 21) or higher, or you will have *aapt* related compile errors.  You can still set the Target Framework which your app is compiled against as low as Android 4.0.3 (API Level 15).\n\n\nUsing GridLayout\n------\n\n#####grid_layout_1.xml\n```xml\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\n\u003candroid.support.v7.widget.GridLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:background=\"@drawable/blue\"\n    android:padding=\"10dip\"\n    app:columnCount=\"4\"\u003e\n    \u003cTextView\n        android:text=\"@string/grid_layout_1_instructions\" /\u003e\n    \u003cEditText\n        app:layout_gravity=\"fill_horizontal\"\n        app:layout_column=\"0\"\n        app:layout_columnSpan=\"4\" /\u003e\n    \u003cButton\n        android:text=\"@string/grid_layout_1_cancel\"\n        app:layout_column=\"2\" /\u003e\n    \u003cButton\n        android:text=\"@string/grid_layout_1_ok\"\n        android:layout_marginLeft=\"10dip\" /\u003e\n\u003c/android.support.v7.widget.GridLayout\u003e\n```\n#####GridLayout1.cs\n```csharp\n[Activity (Label = \"@string/grid_layout_1\")]\npublic class GridLayout1 : Activity\n{\n\tprotected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)\n\t{\n\t\tbase.OnCreate (bundle);\n\t\tSetContentView(Resource.Layout.grid_layout_1);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n","Hash":"f48d4ecbce1dacc50cfe209cf043d609","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
